# Write Once, Run Anywhere: Portable C++ Code

## Cross-Platform Development

The C++ code you write in this course is fully portable and can be complied and built for:

- Windows
- Linux
- macOS

## How do we achieve portability?

- Modern CMake: a powerful build system that allows seamless cross-platform compilation.
- Standard C++ Libraries:
    - We avoid OS-specific dependencies and stick to industry best practices
- vcpkg Package Manager:
    - Easily manage dependencies on all platforms
- Platform-Independent Code:
    - We use portable system calls and abstractions when needed

# Course Requirements - What You Need to Get Started

## You do not need to be an expert to start!

# Problem-Solving

## Sharpen Your Skills with Hands-On Practice

- Tackle real-world coding challenges with carefully designed exercises
- Build efficient and scalable solutions through practical assignments
- Strengthen your problem-solving mindset with quizzes, projects, and coding challenges
- Why does this matter?
    - Thinking like a developer means breaking down problems, optimizing solutions, and writing better code-skills that will set you apart in any tech field

# Debugging & Compile-Time Mastery

## Write Code That Works, Every Time

- Learn how to debug efficiently and solve problems like a pro
